# lsst-dsfp-2023

Challenges (and solutions!) for the LSST DSFP 2023.

## Instructions

### Get set up.

Work in pairs, one of you is the driver and the other the navigator.

**Driver:** Has Rubin data rights and is logged in to their account in the 
Rubin Science Platform at data.lsst.cloud.

Need an RSP account? <br>

**Navigator:** Accesses the DP0.2 documentation, data product schemas, 
does the Google searches, etc. Data rights and an RSP account are not needed.

### Pick a challenge from the list below.

Pick any that interest you, they are not sequential.

They are designed to help learn about the Rubin Science Platform
and the Data Preview 0 format and contents, not to learn
about data science.

They're also designed to be pretty simple.

### Give feedback!

The LSST DSFP 2023 are the first to encounter this kind of "challenge" and "solution" arrangement.

At the end of the session, all pairs should stop and have an open discussion about the
challenges and solutions.

Please also email Melissa Graham with your thoughts or to contribute. <br>

### Continue your learning in your own time.

To advance your learning, work through the DP0.2 Portal Tutorials
and Notebook Tutorials (the latter will appear automatically in
your RSP home directory). <br>

Knowing only the approximate coordinates of a particularly bright galaxy (Waldo),

### Challenge 2: Galaxy Cluster Color-Magnitude Diagram

Given the central coordinates of a rich galaxy cluster, make a
color-magnitude diagram.

### Challenge 3: Variable Star Check

Be a good friend and check if LSST knows whether a star is variable.



## Notebook Challenges

### Challenge 4: Datashader

Use the plotting package `datashader` to make an interactive plot of a million or more data points.

### Challenge 5:
