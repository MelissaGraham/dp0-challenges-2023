# Challenge 1: Galaxy Hunt

In the DP0.2 documentation, the first figure on the DP0.2 data products page
has three panels: the grid of tracts, the image of tract 3828, and a zoom-in
image approximately centered near a particularly bright elongated galaxy.

Use the Portal Aspect to find the `ObjectId` of that galaxy in the DP0.2 `Object` catalog.

## Hint

Don't get fancy.
Query for bright extended objects near the tract center and then visually review
the results until you spy the target.
